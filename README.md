# PKM tools
Some tools I use for PKM in Obsidian.

## Highlight saver
This browser extension enables users to effortlessly save selected text from webpages into a daily note on their computer. With just a click, it captures highlighted text and optionally the source URL, organizing them in a Markdown-formatted file dated for the current day, ideal for use with applications like Obsidian. Saved snippets are compiled under a '## Highlights' header for easy reference. The extension collaborates with a Node.js application on a local server to ensure secure access to the user's file system.
